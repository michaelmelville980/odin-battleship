# Battleship Game

> A TDD‐driven JavaScript implementation of the classic Battleship game.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

You will build a fully playable Battleship game in JavaScript using Test-Driven Development (TDD). Your code will expose a clean API for:

- **Ship** objects (length, hits, sunk status)  
- **Gameboard** objects (place ships, receive attacks, track misses, all-sunk check)  
- **Player** objects (human vs. computer, own gameboard, take turns, random legal moves)  
- **Controller/UI** module (drive game flow, render boards, handle clicks, end‐game logic)

You will **not** test any DOM rendering—focus on isolating business logic in pure modules, then wire up your UI later.
